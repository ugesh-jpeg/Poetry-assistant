    <h1>Poetry Pal (ノ＞▽＜。)ノ</h1>

    <p>In the yard, a playful dog, chased a frog into a bog.<br>
        Through the misty morning fog, he left his mark on a fallen log.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>A cat with a fancy hat, sat on a soft, warm mat.<br>
        Along came a sneaky rat, with a bat that startled the cat.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>By the old and sturdy tree, buzzed a happy, busy bee.<br>
        In the breeze, feeling free, the world was clear for all to see.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>Up above, the endless sky, where dreams and wishes love to fly.<br>
        Waving the world a sweet bye, as the sun set, a hue so sly.<br><br>
    </p>
